sdphp Meetup Ideas
=========
- Get Devs up to speed w/ OOP like a one day 8 hour course on a sat / sun, 	 I am sure we could get a bunch of companies behind this to support a saturday	 i.e. we come up w/ a proJect that will flex skills as a competent JR - MID PHP dev and have some one lead the presentation, and the more SR people rove the room, and code critique and help the JRs out, i think getting more devs up to speed would be awesome for teh community especially targeting the JRs
